# Welcome to ACL SRW 2023
The ACL Student Research Workshop (SRW) 2023 will be held in conjunction with [ACL 2023](https://2023.aclweb.org/). The SRW gives student researchers in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing the opportunity to present their work and receive constructive feedback and mentorship by experienced members of the ACL community. 
<br>
We will update this site when latest information are available.

Contact us via email at [acl2023-srw@googlegroups.com](mailto:acl2023-srw@googlegroups.com) for any questions.

<!-- ### List of the accepted papers are available [here](/accepted) -->

<!-- # Differences from Past SRWs -->
Similar to past SRWs, ACL 2023 SRW has two submission options--archival (appear in proceedings) and non-archival (only for presentation).
Authors can elect for both research papers and thesis proposals to be non-archival, in order to more explicitly encourage work in progress which can later be submitted to a future (archival) conference.
From a mentorship and reviewing standpoint, archival and nonarchival submissions are treated the same.
See the call for papers for more details.
