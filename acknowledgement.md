The SRW organizing committee and faculty advisors extend their sincere thanks to all reviewers, mentors, area chairs, program chairs, and the broader ACL community for their generous contributions of time and expertise. We look forward to an engaging workshop that offers students valuable opportunities for feedback, networking, and professional development, both in person and virtually. We especially appreciate the collective commitment to mentoring and to creating a welcoming space for the next generation of computational linguists and NLP researchers.
